**Case study:** How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

**Scenario:**

As a data analyst on Cyclistic's marketing team, our focus is on enhancing annual memberships to drive the company's success. We aim to analyze the differing usage patterns between casual riders and annual members to craft a marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders. Our recommendations, supported by data insights and professional visualizations, await Cyclistic executives' approval to proceed.

**About the company**

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a bike-share program in Chicago, growing to 5,824 bikes and 692 stations. Initially, their marketing aimed at broad segments with flexible pricing plans attracting both casual riders (single-ride or full-day passes) and annual members. However, recognizing that annual members are more profitable, Cyclistic is shifting focus to convert casual riders into annual members. To achieve this, they plan to analyze historical bike trip data to understand the differences and preferences between the two user groups, aiming to tailor marketing strategies that encourage casual riders to purchase annual memberships.
